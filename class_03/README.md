**Data Types and Operators**

**Data Types**

In Python, data types define the kind of values a variable can hold. Here are the fundamental data types:

* **String (str):** Represents text enclosed in single or double quotes.
* **Number (int):** Represents whole numbers (integers).
* **Float (float):** Represents decimal numbers.
* **Boolean (bool):** Represents True or False values.
* **List (list):** Represents an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets.

**Operators**

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values. Here are the common operators in Python:

* **Arithmetic Operators:**
  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (-)
  * Multiplication (*)
  * Division (/)
  * Modulus (%)
  * Floor Division (//)
* **Assignment Operators:**
  * (=)
  * (+=)
  * (-=)
  * (*=)
  * (/=)
  * (%=)
  * (//=)
* **Comparison Operators:**
  * (==)
  * (!=)
  * (>)
  * (<)
  * (>=)
  * (<=)
* **Logical Operators:**
  * and (all comparisons should be True)
  * or (at least one comparison should be True)
  * not
* **Identity Operators:**
  * is
  * is not
* **Membership Operators:**
  * in
  * not in

**Remember:**

* Use meaningful variable names to improve code readability.
* Indentation is crucial for Python code structure.
* Practice using these data types and operators to build your Python programming skills.

**Additional Tips:**

* Explore more advanced data types like dictionaries and sets.
* Experiment with different operators and their combinations.
* Refer to Python's official documentation for in-depth information.

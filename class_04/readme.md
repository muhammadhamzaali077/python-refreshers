## Python Tutorial: Class 04 - Iteration, Sequences, and Operations

**Welcome to Class 04!**

In this class, we'll dive deeper into Python's core features that enable efficient iteration, manipulation, and creation of sequences.

**Topics Covered:**

* **For Loops:** Learn how to iterate over various data structures using `for` loops, providing a structured way to repeat actions.
* **Tuples:** Understand the concept of tuples, immutable sequences that can store heterogeneous data.
* **List Comprehensions:** Discover the concise and powerful syntax of list comprehensions for generating lists in a single expression.
* **Slicing:** Explore how to extract specific portions of lists and strings using slicing, a versatile technique.
* **Range Function:** Learn about the `range()` function for creating sequences of numbers, commonly used in loops and indexing.

**How to Use This Tutorial:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Download and set up the code repository.
2. **Follow Along:** Watch the video and follow the code examples.
3. **Experiment:** Modify the code to explore different scenarios and deepen your understanding.

**By the end of this class, you'll be able to:**

* Use `for` loops effectively to iterate over sequences.
* Create and manipulate tuples for storing data.
* Generate lists efficiently using list comprehensions.
* Extract specific parts of sequences using slicing.
* Create sequences of numbers with the `range()` function.

# Python Tutorial: For Loops, Tuples, List Comprehensions, Slicing, and Range | Class_04
Welcome to Class_04 of our Python programming series. This class focuses on core Python concepts including for loops, tuples, list comprehensions, slicing, and the range() function. Each topic is explained with practical examples to help you understand how to write efficient and optimized Python code.

# Contents:
For Loops
Learn how to iterate over sequences and collections using Pythonâ€™s for loop and understand its syntax and common use cases.

# Tuples
Discover what tuples are, their properties (immutability), and how they differ from lists. Explore when and why to use tuples in Python programming.

# List Comprehensions
Get introduced to one of Python's most powerful features, list comprehensions, which allow you to generate lists using minimal code.

# Slicing
Learn how to access parts of lists and strings using slicing, a fundamental technique for efficient data manipulation.

# Range Function
Understand the range() function, commonly used for generating sequences of numbers and controlling loop iterations.
